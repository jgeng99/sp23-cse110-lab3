        <h2>Last Meeting</h2>
          <p>
            Last meeting we breifly talked about the potential of Ai
            and how human can benefit from it. For this meeting we will
            have some guests talk over for us why we cannot rely
            100% on AI but should be extra careful. In case you missed
            last meeting, you can refer <a href="#">here</a> for last meeting's notes.

<!-- 
any miscellaneous comments / questions / concerns that anyone would like to bring up
pictures of any diagrams / architecture / things that were 
 presented
     SWE meetings often have people diagram things on a whiteboard so we want those captured as well
For the following two, you can simply take a 30 second pretend
 audio recording & video recording to use, we are just trying
 to get you familiar with the <audio> and <video> elements. Yes,
 you must have both audio and video elements, and yes, you can use 
 the audio from the video you took for the audio element, it just 
 has to be in a separate audio file.
